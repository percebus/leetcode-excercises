Feature: Cafeteria

  # A cafeteria table consists of a row of N seats,
  # numbered from 1 to N from left to right.
  # Social distancing guidelines require that every diner be seated such that
  # K seats to their left and K seats to their right
  # (or all the remaining seats to that side if there are fewer than K) remain empty.
  # There are currently M diners seated at the table, the ith of whom is in seat Si
  # No two diners are sitting in the same seat, and the social distancing guidelines are satisfied.
  # Determine the maximum number of additional diners who can potentially sit at the table
  # without social distancing guidelines being violated for any new or existing diners,
  # assuming that the existing diners cannot move and that the additional diners
  # will cooperate to maximize how many of them can sit down.
  #
  # Constraints
  #  * 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^15
  #  * 1 ≤ K ≤ N
  #  * 1 ≤ M ≤ 500,000
  #  * M ≤ N
  #  * 1 ≤ Si ≤ N
  Scenario Outline: _
    Given a number <N> of seats
      And social distancing <K>
      And current diners <S>, of size <M>
     When I call getMaxAdditionalDinersCount
     Then I get the potential maximum number of additional diner <new_clients>
  Examples:
    |  N | K |     S     | M | new_clients |
    | 10 | 1 | 2, 6      | 2 |           3 |
    | 15 | 2 | 11, 6, 14 | 3 |           1 |
